##Roman numerals refactored

####This is a refactored version of a ruby method for transforming a passed in number into Roman numerals. If you would like to see the previous version you can view it [here](https://github.com/coreypnorris/roman_numerals) It currently only works on numbers up to 3999.

To use it just copy the code from the lib/roman_numerals_refactored.rb file and paste it into a ruby client (Here's a link that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type â€˜roman_numerals_refactored(your-number-here)' in the client.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/roman-numerals) was meant to stretch the limits of our understanding of basic ruby code.
